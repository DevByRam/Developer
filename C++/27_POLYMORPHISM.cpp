    // -one name and multiple forms
    // eg. Function Overloading , Operator overloading
    // eg. Virtual Functions

    // Polymorphism is of 2 types :
    /* 1.compile time polymorphism -> Definition: Compile-time polymorphism occurs when the method or function to be executed is determined during compilation.
    Techniques:
        Function Overloading: Defining multiple functions with the same name but different parameter lists (either in number, type, or order of parameters) within the same class.
        
        Operator Overloading: Redefining operators to work with user-defined types.
    */
    /* 2.Run time polymorphism -> Definition: Run-time polymorphism occurs when the method or function to be executed is determined during runtime.
    Techniques:
        Method Overriding: A derived class provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its base class. This is typically achieved with inheritance and virtual functions.
