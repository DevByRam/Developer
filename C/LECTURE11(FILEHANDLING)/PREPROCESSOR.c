/*
#include<stdio.h>
here
#include is preprocessor directive 
<stdio.h> means standard input output header.this is responsible for printf() and scanf()
for mathematical inputs we need another header file that is #include<math.h> such as for float f = sqrt(7);
and float f = cbrt(8);
similarly #include<limits.h> for limits
